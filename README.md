I have just completed my 2nd year and with the help of Allah Almighty I have finally secured admission in Fast Khi. The whole entry test procedure was quite stressful and depressing but I have faced all the challenges. I am quite good in academics.
Beside academics I also have a bunch of hobbies like:
- Badminton
- Book reading
- E gaming<br />
I have also worked upon my soft skills during my college year:
1. I got a certficate of Word Associate.
2. I have good communication skills.
3. I am good leader and knows how to lead a team in adverse circumstances.
4. I can handle work load and can perform well in stressful environments.
That was all about me.
